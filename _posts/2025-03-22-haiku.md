These are some haiku I wrote in 2010.

---
<br>
a song never sung<br>
a tragic flash – here, then gone<br>
love, un-manifest

clothes cover our skin<br>
sadly, we fear exposure<br>
souls, too, are covered

warm sand on my toes<br>
I shiver from a cool breeze<br>
I miss your smile

introspective boy<br>
no jacket in gentle rain<br>
finds he is in love

my scattered mind drifts<br>
cold wind pierces my chapped lips<br>
I'm thinking of you

fiercer than desire<br>
powerful affinity<br>
love, less plain than need

wormhole extending<br>
subtly, consciousness combines<br>
your pains are with me

pressed lips, careful eyes<br>
his words seem practiced and terse<br>
suddenly, she feels

this spring, I will hide<br>
afraid of what I might say<br>
I'll escape to thought

a moonlit daydream<br>
of a smile with no face<br>
melts my heart away

thundering whisper<br>
in a cold endless winter<br>
descends to my soul

the proud man is blind –<br>
finds no peace in solitude<br>
no truth in beauty

in your arms I sleep<br>
I find comfort in my dreams<br>
alas, I awake

rain falls as time slows<br>
we are the empty boardwalk<br>
lonely in winter

alone, but with you<br>
the great distance between us<br>
cannot destroy dreams

with you, but alone<br>
separate with words not spoken<br>
we know what's missing
