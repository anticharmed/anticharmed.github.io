An omnibenevolent being could only act in one way in any circumstanceâ€”the way that is most good. It would not have the ability to do otherwise. Would it be rational to say that it lacks a free will, though, when it deliberates and chooses only the most good action?

People are the same: We each have an individual spirit that motivates action. A person's ability to choose an outcome is not diminished because the person he is determines his action. This is the assertion of his will. Whether you call that "free will" or not is semantics. But it's the only will that a rational actor can weild within logical coherence.
