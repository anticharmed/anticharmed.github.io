In 1953, my grandmother dropped a book called _Fort Amity_ on a train coming home from her office job at a British military base. The stranger who reached to pick up the book was my grandfather. The same copy of Fort Amity now sits on my bookshelf, an inscription left by her sister Marcia reminding me that from a sister’s simple gift of “best wishes” comes everyone I love; from noise comes signal.  

She was born on Halloween of 1931—a spooky fact she relished. She died the Monday after Halloween of 2015. The week before, she told me “next week, I’m going to be 84. Isn’t that something?”  

As long as I can remember, I marveled at her stories of a childhood in India; I saw her dear memories of her father switching from instrument to instrument, filling the house with music in the evening; I knew the family lore of Fort Amity—but I didn’t know what the book was about.  

I asked.  

“Darling, you must read it and find out”. I took her up on the offer, finding the copy on a dusty shelf, hugging her and everyone I love goodbye, I returned to a place I seldom think of as home.  

The next weekend, I returned to a place where ‘home’ has been slipping away. My cousin Megan and I made our way down a hallway—a list of questions neglected for years, compiled. What else could we discover?  

A squeeze of the hand and the same warm smile I think she’s worn since 1931 was all my grandmother could offer. It was everything we’d lost and all that we needed.  

Her funeral was held on Friday, November 13th, the same day of the violence in Paris and Beirut. We watched the aftermath of senseless destruction on a television screen from happy hour at the Elbow Room. We’d come from a cemetery where a deacon wearing sunglasses told her children he was sorry for their loss; a reception where I asked my cousin Kayren how she’s been for the last 20 years; a Mass where a rambling priest struggled for meaning in a liturgy for the life of a stranger.  

I felt nihilism set in, and I let it grow. But the beauty of a world devoid of inherent meaning is that there are no bounds when inserting your own.
