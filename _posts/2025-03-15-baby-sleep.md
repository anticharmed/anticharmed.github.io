I've started reading about infant sleep to be prepared as a new father.  These are some notes to remember:  

## On Sleep

1. **Pause briefly before responding to night wakings.**  
   Newborns often make noises or cry briefly in their sleep, especially during REM cycles. Instead of immediately intervening, it's helpful to wait a few moments to see if the baby naturally settles back to sleep. However, if a baby is clearly hungry or distressed, responding promptly is important.  

2. **If the baby remains unsettled, then respond.**  
   After waiting a short time to observe whether the baby is truly awake and in need, you should step in to soothe and feed as needed.  

3. **Longer sleep stretches are possible by 3-4 months, but normal variability exists.**  
   While some babies naturally sleep through the night (or at least longer stretches) by this age, others may still wake for feeds, which is developmentally normal. Sleep patterns depend on factors like feeding, temperament, and biological readiness.  

## On Feeding

1. **In the first few weeks, feed on demand.**  
   Newborns should be fed whenever they show hunger cues, typically every 2-3 hours across each 24-hour period. There's no need for rigid structure in this early stage.  

2. **Encourage full feedings while following hunger cues.**  
   Over time, introduce some gentle structure by:  
   - Keeping the baby awake for full feedings instead of short, frequent "snacking."  
   - Gradually spacing out feeds (e.g., if feeding every 2 hours, gently stretching to 2.5 or 3 hours when the baby seems ready).

3. **Introduce a loose feeding rhythm around 2 months, based on baby's natural patterns.**  
   Around 6-8 weeks, babies often settle into a flexible but structured rhythm, such as:  
   - Morning → Mid-morning → Lunch → Afternoon → Dinner → Evening → Nighttime.  

   This should be adapted to baby's cues, not forced.  

4. **Nighttime feeds often decrease as daytime intake increases, but not for all babies.**  
   By 3 months, many babies naturally reduce night wakings as they consume more calories during the day. However, some babies still need nighttime feeds for healthy growth.  

5. **Feeding structure may help sleep but isn't the only factor.**  
   Ensuring a baby eats enough during the day can support longer sleep stretches, but sleep regulation also depends on factors like developmental stage, sleep environment, and individual temperament.
