Richard Boyd taught me one thing in an undergraduate seminar: Objectivity does not consist in freedom from supposition. In fact, it requires it. In order to test a hypothesis, you must state your assumptions.

What, then, is subjectivity? It’s when you can’t state your assumptions.

Why is a sunset beautiful? You can try to look internally, but can you really state your reasons for what solicits the reaction in your mind we label ‘beauty’?

And when we hear a critic breaking down an artform to measure it, we recognize that something is diminished. You can define your terms to make something an objective study, but it will feel hollow if we lack access to the information behind the true object of our label.
