I saw Mark Kozalek at a place called The Attic in Santa Cruz. It doesn't exist anymore. I think it was over the Blue Lagoon, but I don't really remember.  

When we walked in, the venue was playing Jack Johnson. When Mark walked on stage, he sort of gave the audience a knowing look.  

The show was uninterrupted bliss for 30 minutes. At the time, I was obsessed with _Ghosts of the Great Highway_. (I still am.) It was the first time I'd heard any of Mark's songs played live.  

In the middle of the delivery of some delicate lyric, all of a sudden the roaring bass from below overwhelmed the sound in the room. It was from a metal band doing their sound check at the bar downstairs.  Mark commented that is might be a sign for him to focus on his acting career, and that perhaps we'd be better of just going back to the Jack Johnson lead in music instead.  

At the time, I think I was disappointed in how the night turned. But looking back, the lost verses of that night made for the perfect Mark Kozalek experience.
